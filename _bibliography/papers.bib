  abstract={Within this dissertation , a number of theories have been discussed such as the 2-D
conformal field theory in addition to provided an introduction to (bosonic string) string
theory which is underpinned by the vertex operator and DDF operators which were used
to create the coherent states. Pre-requisites for creating coherent states such as NambuGoto action, Polyakov action, Virasoro algebra, vertex operator, DelGuidice, DiVecchia
and Fubini (DDF) operator have been analysed within the dissertation.},

  abstract={Mg doped ZnO dilute magnetic semiconductors prepared by chemical method for various
doses from 1% to 5%. ZnO and Mg doped ZnO samples were characterized using XRD,
SEM and SQUID techniques to study the structural, morphological and magnetic
properties respectively. The XRD data of ZnO sample showed the peaks at 31.420, 34.160,
360, 47.460, 56.380, 62.660, 67.760, and 76.940 corresponding to the lattice planes (100),
(002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), and (202) respectively. The intensity of these
peaks was found to be reducing with doping percentage. FWHM of samples varies with
the doping percentage. SQUID technique showed ferromagnetic behaviors of all doped
samples. The Curie temperature for doped samples showed ferromagnetism above room
temperature. SEM technique showed the nano rods in the samples and size of nanorods
were found to be in the range of 20-50 nm. As the doping is increased, agglomeration in
ZnO takes place which changes its shape of nanorods.},
