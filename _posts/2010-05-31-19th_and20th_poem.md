For years and years have passed the years,  
But I was born in the twenty-first turn,  
Indeed was I late to arrive, but I read about it,  


The nineteenth and twentieth had a flavour of joy,  
and the spirit of consciousness and enthusiasm,  
I wish I could be there to fondle the air,  
Indeed was I late to arrive, but I read about it,  


It woke up with a dream and lived to achieve it,  
But I was born in the twenty-first turn,  
Indeed was I late to arrive, but I read about it,  
Indeed was I late to arrive, but I read about it.
