वो पुराने दिन \\
वो सुहाने दिन \\
आशिक़ाने दिन \\
ओस की नमी में भीगे \\
वो पुराने दिन


दिन गुज़र गए \\
हम किधर गए \\
पीछे मुड़ के देखा पाया \\
सब ठहर गए \\
अकेले हैं खड़े \\
क़दम नहीं बढ़े \\
चल पड़ेंगे जब भी कोई \\
राह चल पड़े 


जाएँगे कहाँ \\
है कुछ पता नहीं \\
कह रहे हैं वो \\
कि उनकी है ख़ता नहीं \\
वो सुहाने दिन \\
आशिक़ाने दिन \\
ओस की नमी में भीगे \\
वो पुराने दिन… 



#### English translation:

Those good old days \\
Those wonderful days \\
Those lovely days \\
Days which were like touching fresh dew \\
Those good old days


Gone are those days now \\
Where are we now? \\
When I look back and see \\
Everyone has stopped far behind \\
I am standing alone \\
Unable to move further \\
I will again start walking again \\
Once there is a road that I can walk on


Where will I go? \\
I dont know \\
He/She had told me \\
That it is not their mistake


Those good old days \\
Those wonderful days \\
Those lovely days \\
Days which were like touching fresh dew \\
Those good old days
