# SPY-QQQ pair trading
Pair trading strategy for SPY and QQQ. The research and backtesting of the strategy can be accessed [here.](https://github.com/Pratikbhanuse/SPY_QQQ-pair-trading)

This strategy is a very basic form of a type of stratiegies called pair trading. In this I have tried to find a correlation primiarily and once I extablished that. I developed a strategy to invoke my code to backtest the strategy on quantopian. 

Details about the files:
* SPX_QQQ_corr.ipynb (jupyter notebook) and SPX_QQQ_corr.py (python) files are the scource code to analyse the correlation between SPY and QQQ. *Also, the analysis was done on quantopian platform notebook so you might encounter issues with few function whilst using the code on any python IDE*. 
* SPY_QQQ_pairtrading_quantopian file is the source code for backtesting the strategy on quantopian. 

Anyone who'd like to access this project through quantopian to view the risk parameters, please click on the [https://www.quantopian.com/posts/spy-and-qqq-pair-trading](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/spy-and-qqq-pair-trading). 

Please feel free to use it and I sincerely, welcome suggestions and imporovements on the strategy.
