**Hello World! Welcome to my website…**

Hi, I’m Pratik! I’m currently working as a Quantitative Researcher at [BCA Research](https://www.bcaresearch.com/){:target="_blank"} and pursuing a Ph.D. in Theoretical and Computational Physics at [The University of Western Ontario](https://www.physics.uwo.ca/people/graduate_students/index.html){:target="_blank"}. My academic and professional journeys converge in my passion for applying principles of physics and mathematics to the world of finance.

With an M.Sc. in Materials Physics from Brock University and ongoing doctoral research, I specialize in quantitative finance, building data-driven models and strategies for investment and trading. My toolkit includes Python, C++, SQL, MATLAB, and more, which I use to solve complex financial challenges by blending mathematics, statistics, and programming.

Outside of work and research, I share insights about finance and life in Canada through my YouTube channel, ["Pratik's Letters"](https://www.youtube.com/c/PratiksLetters){:target="_blank"}. I also enjoy photography, and you can explore my visual work on Instagram at ["vadapav_cuttingchai"](https://www.instagram.com/vadapav_cuttingchai/){:target="_blank"}.

Feel free to browse through my blog, share your thoughts, and connect with me for collaborations or discussions. If you’d like to know more about my professional background, check out my [complete CV](/assets/pdf/Pratik-Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Thanks for visiting!


<!-- 
Hello World! Welcome to my website...

Hi, this is Pratik! Currently working as a Quantitative Researcher at [BCA Research](https://www.bcaresearch.com/).
I am a theoretical physicist by education and enthusiastic and curious about the implementation of laws of physics 
and tools in mathematics in the realm of finance and economics.

Academically speaking I completed my M.Sc. in Materials Physics from Brock University. I like to learn 
computer programming as it helps me to visuallise, pratically implement concepts from physics and mathematics. 
Currently I am involved in researching strategies and building models for investment and trading based on ideas from mathematics and statistics. If you'd like to know more about 
me please view my [Complete CV](/assets/pdf/Pratik-Resume-website.pdf){:target="_blank"}.


I live in Canada and also make videos on my life in Canada. You can go and check out my YouTube 
channel - ["Pratik's Letters"](https://www.youtube.com/c/PratiksLetters){:target="_blank"}. You can also check out 
my photography on my Intagram handle ["vadapav_cuttingchai"](https://www.instagram.com/vadapav_cuttingchai/){:target="_blank"}.

Also, explore my blogs and feel free to comment your views and suggest new ideas on which you'd like 
me to talk about. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `profile_image.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
