**Hello World! Welcome to my website…**

Welcome! I’m Pratik, a researcher and analyst passionate about the intersection of physics, mathematics, and finance.

I have four years of experience as a Quantitative Researcher, including my time at [BCA Research](https://www.bcaresearch.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I applied advanced mathematical and computational techniques to financial markets. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Theoretical and Computational Physics at [The University of Western Ontario](https://www.physics.uwo.ca/people/graduate_students/index.html){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Prof. Colin Denniston](https://www.physics.uwo.ca/people/faculty_web_pages/denniston.html){:target="_blank"}, focusing on molecular dynamics and polymer networks. My research applies neural network concepts to build predictive models for polymer properties, enhancing our understanding of complex materials.

My work explores how principles from physics—such as statistical mechanics and computational modeling—can provide deeper insights into financial markets, risk management, and investment strategies. I also have experience in financial modeling, algorithmic trading, and data-driven decision-making.

With an M.Sc. in Materials Physics from Brock University and ongoing doctoral research, I specialize in quantitative finance, building data-driven models and strategies for investment and trading. My toolkit includes Python, C++, SQL, MATLAB, and more, which I use to solve complex financial challenges by blending mathematics, statistics, and programming.

Beyond research, I enjoy sharing insights on financial markets, quantitative methods, and life in Canada through my YouTube channel, ["Pratik's Letters"](https://www.youtube.com/c/PratiksLetters){:target="_blank"}. I’m also passionate about photography—check out my visual work on Instagram at ["vadapav_cuttingchai"](https://www.instagram.com/vadapav_cuttingchai/){:target="_blank"}.

Feel free to browse through my blog, share your thoughts, and connect with me for collaborations or discussions. If you’d like to know more about my professional background, check out my [complete CV](/assets/pdf/Pratik-Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Thanks for visiting!

Hello World! Welcome to my website...

Hi, this is Pratik! Currently working as a Quantitative Researcher at [BCA Research](https://www.bcaresearch.com/).
I am a theoretical physicist by education and enthusiastic and curious about the implementation of laws of physics 
and tools in mathematics in the realm of finance and economics.

Academically speaking I completed my M.Sc. in Materials Physics from Brock University. I like to learn 
computer programming as it helps me to visuallise, pratically implement concepts from physics and mathematics. 
Currently I am involved in researching strategies and building models for investment and trading based on ideas from mathematics and statistics. If you'd like to know more about 
me please view my [Complete CV](/assets/pdf/Pratik-Resume-website.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I live in Canada and also make videos on my life in Canada. You can go and check out my YouTube 
channel - ["Pratik's Letters"](https://www.youtube.com/c/PratiksLetters){:target="_blank"}. You can also check out 
my photography on my Intagram handle ["vadapav_cuttingchai"](https://www.instagram.com/vadapav_cuttingchai/){:target="_blank"}.

Also, explore my blogs and feel free to comment your views and suggest new ideas on which you'd like 
me to talk about. -->
